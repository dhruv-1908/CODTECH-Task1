Technologies Used in the To-Do List Application

The To-Do List Application is built using the following core web technologies to ensure simplicity and ease of use:

HTML:

Used for structuring the content and layout of the web pages. Provides the semantic elements that form the backbone of the application's user interface.

CSS3:

Employed for styling the application to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design. Utilizes Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout and design adaptability across different screen sizes.

JavaScript:

Powers the interactive and dynamic functionality of the application. Manages tasks such as adding, editing, and deleting items. Handles user input and updates the DOM (Document Object Model) to reflect changes in real-time. Implements features like task prioritization, due dates, and reminders using local storage to maintain data persistence across sessions.

Key Features of the To-Do List Application

Task Management:

Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks: Users can effortlessly add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks that are no longer needed. This functionality is implemented using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user. Mark Complete: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete, helping them track their progress. Completed tasks are visually distinguished using CSS styling. Data Persistence:

Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that user data is preserved across sessions. This means that even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page, their tasks will remain intact and accessible. This feature leverages JavaScript's localStorage API to store and retrieve task data.
